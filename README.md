## Professional Experience ‚åõ

I have been working as a front-end web developer for **6 years**, with a particular expertise in JavaScript, Typescript, React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.

## Passion and Goal ‚ù§Ô∏èüåü

What excites me the most about frontend web development is the opportunity to create applications that are accessible worldwide with just a few clicks. **My goal is to design high-performance, accessible, pixel-perfect, and responsive user interfaces.**

## Approaches and Methodologies üõ†Ô∏è

I follow a **performance-driven approach**, ensuring that the graphical interfaces I create are optimized to provide a seamless user experience. I also place great importance on **accessibility** to make my applications usable by all.

## Development Tools and Environment üß∞

I regularly work with

 ![vscode](https://img.shields.io/badge/VSCode-0078D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual%20studio%20code&logoColor=white) 
 
 for my front-end development. It's my preferred environment due to its flexibility and rich set of features.

## Additional Skills üí™

Outside of front-end web development, I also have experience as a former **high-level athlete**, representing the French trampoline teams. This experience taught me **perseverance, discipline, and the ability to work in a team**.

## Contributions and Open Source Projects üë•

I'm open to collaborations and **open source** projects. Feel free to reach out if you have any interesting ideas!
